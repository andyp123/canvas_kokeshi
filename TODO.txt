TODO:
+ more refined updating of kokeshi
  - head shouldn't shake to begin with
  - head shake should match tempo
  - level up should be animated better
  - move level up sound from game manager to kokeshi?
  - face should animate depending on how well player is doing
+ add koto and taiko players
  - koto played by woman
  - taiko played by man
  - simple animation - 1 or 2 frames per beat
  - animation depends on beat type?
+ particle effects
  - fireworks in bg on game clear
  - timeline beats should shoot into the air and power up the kokeshi on stage clear
  - small heart particles from characters
  - some kind of effect for missed beats
+ more patterns
  - another 1 or 2 master patterns
  - more hard patterns?
  - hard + medium should be merged?
  - master is new hard?
+ better beat matching
  - current system not robust on harder patterns
  - success should not be so black/white as it is now - require percentage to clear (80%+)
  - more feedback on missed or bum notes
+ check all sound files and trim any crap from the start and end
+ convert all sounds to ogg? leave as wav?
+ free play mode
