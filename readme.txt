----------------------------------- KOKESHI ------------------------------------
A rhythm action game for Global Game Jam 2013 by Andrew Palmer (aka Mr Flamey)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: this version of Kokeshi is still gameplay incomplete as it is being
submitted into the Global Game Jam 2013 to meet the deadline. I will continue
to work on it over the next couple of days and add the missing features, as
the current version is more of a music toy than a rhythm game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kokeshi is a Japanese themed rhythm action game where you must master the koto
and taiko drum in order to play music to enchant and bring to life a giant
kokeshi doll.

How does this tie into the theme?
The taiko drum is intended to be like the heartbeat of the living doll, but I
have yet to implement this :/

Also, there is a bit on wikipedia that I found interesting:
"In Looking for the Lost, Alan Booth suggests that kokeshi may be fetish
substitutes for unwanted babies killed after birth and the characters can be
understood as 子消し (made up of child (子 ko) and erasing, extinguishing
(消し keshi)"

I thought that maybe the two instrumentalists (not yet implemented!) on either
side of the doll could be a couple who had a baby that they killed and are
trying to capture the soul of their baby in the kokeshi doll in order to be
forgiven by the gods.


Controls
--------
Timeline colours:

RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE map to four keys for each player in the order below:
 Player 1 (Koto harp): press Q,W,E,R for different tones (low to high)
 Player 2 (Taiko drum): U,I,O,P for different tones (chu, shime1, shime2, stick)
Of course, 1 player can also control both players for extra fun and challenge!

Press space to enable autoplay. This makes the computer play the rhythm in the
timeline at the bottom. Although the timeline is the core of the game, it is
still not finished!

Intended gameplay
-----------------
The kokeshi doll on the platform in the middle of the screen should start off
without any features painted onto it. By accurately playing the music on the
timeline, players gradually create magical brushstrokes that add detail to the
kokeshi doll. When a certain number of pieces of music have been mastered, the
doll will be fully painted and come to life. YOU WIN!

Each player can plays only one note at a time. For greater challenge, try
player single player and controlling both players!
