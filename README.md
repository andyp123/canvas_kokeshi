Kokeshi
=======

Kokeshi is a super amazing rhythm game where you must bring the kokeshi to life with your magical taiko.

Although the game isn't really finished, you can play it by clicking this link:

It's very hard with just one player. Perhaps if you are a concert pianist, you will have the manual dexterity to play the later parts, but you need to get 100% or you cannot advance to the next stage.
